First Law (Law of Inertia) An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. Explains the concept of inertia . If no net force acts on an object, its velocity remains constant. Mathematically: $$ \\sum F = 0 \\Rightarrow v = \\text{constant} $$ 2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration) The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net external force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Defines the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration: $$ F = ma $$ where: \\(F\\) is the net force (N) \\(m\\) is the mass (kg) \\(a\\) is the acceleration ( \\(m/s^2\\) ) If force increases, acceleration increases (for constant mass). 3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs. If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A: $$ F_{A o B} = -F_{B o A} $$ Applications First Law: Seatbelts in cars prevent passengers from continuing forward when a car stops suddenly. Second Law: A heavier object requires more force to accelerate than a lighter object. Third Law: When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with an equal force.

Unlike oblique projectile motion, there is no horizontal displacement, and the motion consists of upward movement until the highest point and then downward free fall. Equations of Motion Since the projectile moves only in the vertical direction, the kinematic equations govern its motion. The key variables involved are: Initial velocity : \\(u\\) Final velocity : \\(v\\) Acceleration due to gravity : \\(g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) (downward) Time of flight : \\(T\\) Maximum height : \\(H\\) Displacement : \\(s\\) The standard kinematic equations are: \\[ v = u + at \\] \\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] \\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \\] For projectile motion at \\(90^\\circ\\) , the acceleration \\(a\\) is replaced by \\(-g\\) (since gravity acts downward). Time of Flight The total time taken for the projectile to reach its peak and return to the initial position is called the time of flight. It consists of two phases: Ascent phase : The object moves upward until velocity becomes zero. Descent phase : The object falls back to the original position. For the ascent phase , at the maximum height, \\(v = 0\\) . Using the first equation of motion: \\[ 0 = u - g t \\] Solving for time to reach the maximum height: \\[ t_{\\text{up}} = \\frac{u}{g} \\] Since the descent time is equal to ascent time, the total time of flight is: \\[ T = 2 \\times \\frac{u}{g} = \\frac{2u}{g} \\] Maximum Height The maximum height \\(H\\) is found using the third equation of motion with \\(v = 0\\) at the peak: \\[ 0 = u^2 - 2gH \\] Solving for \\(H\\) : \\[ H = \\frac{u^2}{2g} \\] Velocity at Any Time The velocity at any instant \\(t\\) during the flight is given by: \\[ v = u - g t \\] If \\(t = T = \\frac{2u}{g}\\) , then: \\[ v = u - g \\left( \\frac{2u}{g} \\right) = -u \\] which indicates that the object returns with the same speed but in the opposite direction. Graphical Representation Velocity-Time Graph : The velocity decreases linearly from \\(u\\) to \\(0\\) at the highest point, then increases in the negative direction until \\(-u\\) at landing. Displacement-Time Graph : The displacement increases, reaching a maximum, then decreases symmetrically. Acceleration-Time Graph : A constant value of \\(-g\\) throughout the motion. Conclusion Projectile motion at \\(90^\\circ\\) is a special case of vertical motion where: - The horizontal displacement is zero. - The time of flight depends only on the initial velocity. - The maximum height is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity. - The velocity changes symmetrically about the highest point. This motion is fundamental in understanding free-fall motion and applications like rocketry, vertical throws, and gravitational acceleration experiments.","title":"Problem 3.03.2025 Projectile Motion at 90 Degrees (Vertical Motion)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-3032025-projectile-motion-at-90-degrees-vertical-motion","text":"","title":"Problem 3.03.2025 Projectile Motion at 90 Degrees (Vertical Motion)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"Projectile motion at an angle of \\(90^\\circ\\) refers to purely vertical motion under the influence of gravity.
