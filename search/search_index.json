General Description The forced damped pendulum is a fascinating example of nonlinear dynamics, where damping, restoring forces, and an external periodic force interact to produce complex behavior. Unlike a simple pendulum, which exhibits predictable periodic motion, a forced damped pendulum can display a range of behaviors, including resonance, quasiperiodicity, and chaos. This problem explores the governing equations, analytical approximations, and computational modeling of the system. By systematically varying the system parameters, we aim to understand its diverse solutions, practical applications, and relevance to real-world phenomena. 2. Useful Formulas and Definitions The equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is given by: \\( \\(\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t)\\) \\) where: - \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement, - \\(b\\) is the damping coefficient, - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, - \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum, - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the external forcing, - \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency, - \\(t\\) represents time. Linearized Approximation for Small Angles For small oscillations ( \\(\\theta \\approx 0\\) ), we can use the approximation \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\) to simplify the equation: \\( \\(\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t)\\) \\) This results in a linear differential equation that can be solved using standard methods. Resonance Condition When the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) matches the natural frequency of the system, resonance occurs, leading to amplified oscillations. The natural frequency for small angles is given by: \\( \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}.\\) \\) If the damping is small, the resonance frequency is approximately: \\( \\(\\omega_r \\approx \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{b^2}{4\\omega_0^2}}.\\) \\) 3. Examples and Computational Implementation Example 1: Analytical Solution for Small Angles For small angles and light damping, the general solution to the linearized equation is given by: [ \\theta(t) = C e^{-\\frac{b}{2}t} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi) + \\theta_p(t) ] where: - \\(C\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are constants determined by initial conditions, - \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4}}\\) is the damped frequency, - \\(\\theta_p(t)\\) is the particular solution due to forcing. Example 2: Numerical Simulation in Python We use the Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the nonlinear differential equation. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp def pendulum(t, y, b, g, L, A, omega): theta, omega_dot = y dtheta_dt = omega_dot domega_dt = -b * omega_dot - (g/L) * np.sin(theta) + A * np.cos(omega * t) return [dtheta_dt, domega_dt] # Parameters b, g, L, A, omega = 0.2, 9.81, 1.0, 0.5, 2.0 t_span = (0, 50) t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 1000) y0 = [0.1, 0] # Initial conditions: small displacement, zero velocity sol = solve_ivp(pendulum, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, args=(b, g, L, A, omega)) # Plot results plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) plt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0], label='Theta (rad)') plt.xlabel('Time (s)') plt.ylabel('Angular displacement (rad)') plt.title('Forced Damped Pendulum Motion') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() Example 3: Phase Portrait and Chaos Exploration To investigate chaotic behavior, we plot phase space diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections. plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) plt.plot(sol.y[0], sol.y[1], label='Phase space') plt.xlabel('Theta (rad)') plt.ylabel('Angular velocity (rad/s)') plt.title('Phase Portrait of the Forced Damped Pendulum') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() 4. Discussion and Extensions Practical Applications: Mechanical Oscillators: Suspension bridges and vehicle suspensions experience similar damping and forcing effects. Electrical Circuits: Driven RLC circuits share the same mathematical framework. Energy Harvesting: Devices that extract energy from oscillatory motion use resonance principles. Further Studies: Chaotic Behavior: For certain parameter values, the system exhibits chaos. Investigate bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. Nonlinear Damping: Introducing nonlinear damping terms ( \\(b(\\theta)\\) ) for more realistic modeling. Non-Periodic Forcing: Studying quasiperiodic and stochastic forcing effects. 5. Conclusion The forced damped pendulum is a rich system for studying nonlinear dynamics, resonance, and chaos. By combining analytical approximations with computational simulations, we gain deep insights into its behavior. The study of this system has significant implications across various fields of science and engineering.

Unlike oblique projectile motion, there is no horizontal displacement, and the motion consists of upward movement until the highest point and then downward free fall. Equations of Motion Since the projectile moves only in the vertical direction, the kinematic equations govern its motion. The key variables involved are: Initial velocity : \\(u\\) Final velocity : \\(v\\) Acceleration due to gravity : \\(g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) (downward) Time of flight : \\(T\\) Maximum height : \\(H\\) Displacement : \\(s\\) The standard kinematic equations are: \\[ v = u + at \\] \\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] \\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \\] For projectile motion at \\(90^\\circ\\) , the acceleration \\(a\\) is replaced by \\(-g\\) (since gravity acts downward). Time of Flight The total time taken for the projectile to reach its peak and return to the initial position is called the time of flight. It consists of two phases: Ascent phase : The object moves upward until velocity becomes zero. Descent phase : The object falls back to the original position. For the ascent phase , at the maximum height, \\(v = 0\\) . Using the first equation of motion: \\[ 0 = u - g t \\] Solving for time to reach the maximum height: \\[ t_{\\text{up}} = \\frac{u}{g} \\] Since the descent time is equal to ascent time, the total time of flight is: \\[ T = 2 \\times \\frac{u}{g} = \\frac{2u}{g} \\] Maximum Height The maximum height \\(H\\) is found using the third equation of motion with \\(v = 0\\) at the peak: \\[ 0 = u^2 - 2gH \\] Solving for \\(H\\) : \\[ H = \\frac{u^2}{2g} \\] Velocity at Any Time The velocity at any instant \\(t\\) during the flight is given by: \\[ v = u - g t \\] If \\(t = T = \\frac{2u}{g}\\) , then: \\[ v = u - g \\left( \\frac{2u}{g} \\right) = -u \\] which indicates that the object returns with the same speed but in the opposite direction. Graphical Representation Velocity-Time Graph : The velocity decreases linearly from \\(u\\) to \\(0\\) at the highest point, then increases in the negative direction until \\(-u\\) at landing. Displacement-Time Graph : The displacement increases, reaching a maximum, then decreases symmetrically. Acceleration-Time Graph : A constant value of \\(-g\\) throughout the motion. Conclusion Projectile motion at \\(90^\\circ\\) is a special case of vertical motion where: - The horizontal displacement is zero. - The time of flight depends only on the initial velocity. - The maximum height is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity. - The velocity changes symmetrically about the highest point. This motion is fundamental in understanding free-fall motion and applications like rocketry, vertical throws, and gravitational acceleration experiments.","title":"Problem 3.03.2025 Projectile Motion at 90 Degrees (Vertical Motion)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-3032025-projectile-motion-at-90-degrees-vertical-motion","text":"","title":"Problem 3.03.2025 Projectile Motion at 90 Degrees (Vertical Motion)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"Projectile motion at an angle of \\(90^\\circ\\) refers to purely vertical motion under the influence of gravity.

Limits of Sequences 1. Limit of Rational Sequences For a rational sequence of the form: $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(n)}{Q(n)} $$ where \\(P(n)\\) and \\(Q(n)\\) are polynomials, the rule is: - If \\(\\deg(P) < \\deg(Q)\\) , then the limit is \\(0\\) . - If \\(\\deg(P) = \\deg(Q)\\) , then the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients. - If \\(\\deg(P) > \\deg(Q)\\) , then the limit is \\(\\infty\\) or does not exist. Example: $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^2 + 3n}{2 n^2 - 2n} $$ Use the highest power of \\(n\\) in both numerator and denominator. 2. Squeeze Theorem If three sequences satisfy: $$ a_n \\leq b_n \\leq c_n $$ and $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c_n = L, $$ then $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = L. $$ Application: $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n)}{n} $$ Since \\(-1 \\leq \\sin(n) \\leq 1\\) , divide by \\(n\\) and apply the squeeze theorem. 3. Exponential Limit (Euler's Number) A fundamental limit: $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = e. $$ This applies to sequences of the form: $$ a_n = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n. $$ 20. Limits of Real Functions 1. Limit of Rational Functions For a rational function: $$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$ where \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) are polynomials, apply the same rules as for sequences. Example: $$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^3 + 2x^2}{x^4 - 3x^3} $$ Divide by the highest power of \\(x\\) in the denominator. 2. Trigonometric Limits A key formula: $$ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1. $$ For modified expressions, use substitution or L'H\u00f4pital's rule. Example: $$ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(3x)}{2x+1}. $$ Use small-angle approximations or L'H\u00f4pital\u2019s rule. 3. Asymptotes of a Function Horizontal asymptote : \\( \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} f(x) = L\\) \\) means \\(y = L\\) is a horizontal asymptote.
