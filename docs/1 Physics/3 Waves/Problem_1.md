## History

Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 6th century BC. He is credited with the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem.

## Application

The Pythagorean theorem is used to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known.

## Example

If the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle are 3 and 4, the length of the hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as follows:

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$a=3$$

$$b=4$$

we have:

$$c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=\sqrt{9+16}=\sqrt{25}=5$$
